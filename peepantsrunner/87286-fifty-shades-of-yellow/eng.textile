So, I've been writing some stories, not really to post, but just as a way of fleshing out my own fantasies. They mostly have too much sex to post here and too much pee to post to regular erotica sites. This is my shot at making a wetting story that's dripping sexuality without actually having any sex in it. Also, as a note, I have never read or watched the original Fifty shades that my title riffs on, and I'm not going to do research for a pee smut story I wrote in a single sitting. I just know it's got a rich bossy guy and thought the title was funny. Anyway, enjoy!

Fifty Shades of Yellow

First day at a new job. Starting work for a new boss was always a heady mix of fear and excitement, but today was something else entirely. He was very demanding of his assistants. Sir. That was how I was to address him. Just Sir. The middle manager who had hired me last week told me never to waste his time saying his full name. Never waste his time for anything.

The manager, John maybe, or maybe Jack, I don't remember, anyway he had some J name. It wasn't important because I only reported to Sir. Josh or whoever had really run me through a gauntlet of an interview, but when I had passed he'd given me all sorts of crazy instructions on how to make this guy happy. I'm not even sure if it was all real or if he was yanking my chain half the time. "Let's screw with the new girl, see what the dumbest thing we can get her to do is!"

Of course, I was used to these high-flying executive types wanting an assistant to do everything, and I mean everything, for them, and boy was this guy a real high flyer. Founder and CEO of one of these tech giants, this guy was worth billions. Billions and billions. He probably lost ten million every time he stopped working to brush his teeth, so it's no wonder he expects me to handle every part of his life that wasn't work for him. I wonder if I'll have to brush his teeth, too. Jake forgot to mention it, though, if I do.

What Jordan had remembered to tell me, though, was more than enough to make me nervous. "He doesn't do anything for himself that you can do for him. You take notes of everything he says, does, or even thinks. You open his doors. You pull out his chairs. If he walks towards the Red Sea, you'd better figure out how to part it before he gets there. You're his wife, and his mother. If his actual mother calls, you talk to her about her day for him." That one had to be a joke, right? "He also likes to look at beautiful things. He lives in a beautiful house in a beautiful place. His watch costs more than your whole family. You need to be a part of that scenery. Do you have pearls? He likes a woman in pearls. If you don't have any, go buy some, he pays plenty."

I looked at myself in the mirror, wearing the pearl choker necklace and matching stud earrings I'd picked out for today, and nothing else. He might be on to something; I did have a certain elegant eroticism wearing them. After trying on a few outfits to match, I decided on a simple black pencil skirt and a white blouse. A lacy white thong and bra set on underneath, just in case it would matter. In case he wanted to see. I buttoned one fewer of my blouse buttons than my mom would have approved of, slipped into a pair of low black heels, and headed off to work.

Maybe it was nerves, maybe it was the extra cup of coffee I'd had to ensure that I was perky and alert for my new boss, but I really had to pee when I arrived at the high rise office building. I walked into a lavishly decorated lobby, and the tinkling sounds of a magnificent fountain only added to the tingling need between my thighs. I tried instead to focus on the sounds of the grand piano a tuxedo clad man was playing in the corner as I approached the front desk.

"Hi, I'm-" I began as I strode forward, heels clacking loudly on the marble flooring. "Yes, miss, I know who you are. Head on up; he's waiting."

"Already? I'm thirty minutes ear-". Again, I was cut off abruptly. "Yes, and he arrived 45 minutes early to get you up to speed before the day really begins. He doesn't like to wait."

"Oh. Ok," I stammered out. "It's just, I really," I leaned forward, blushing, and whispered, "have to, you know, use the ladies room first. Where is it?"

"He. Doesn't. Like. To. Wait. Go up now, pee later. Top floor, Miss, this card key will let you up."

As I rode the gold plated elevator I wondered what the hell that was all about? I get being in a hurry, but who doesn't let a lady relieve herself? Some over-enthusiastic nobody at the front desk trying to get noticed, that's who. The boss is sure to ask a lot but maybe he won't be that crazy. Anyway, the pay is insane, and its not like I couldn't hold it until after he got through feeling big and telling me all the usual "you exist to serve me, you sleep when I sleep and I never sleep ha ha" stuff these types always had to power trip on.

A shiver of desperation went down my spine. That didn't mean I was losing control; my bladder just wanted to remind me the clock was ticking. I clenched my thighs together as I looked up to check how many floors were left. Right as I started to give myself a squeeze to help resist another wave of urgency, I noticed the security camera right next to the floor indicator, and had to pretend I was using my hand to brush a piece of lint from my little black skirt instead.

After another eternal minute trying to pee dance as subtly as possible, the elevator dinged and came to a stop. I had hoped to sneak into a bathroom in the hallway before heading into his office, but apparently the entire top floor was his office. The doors slid open and I stepped out directly up to his secretary's desk. The young man smiled as he waved me in, too caught up talking rapidly into his headset to even say hello.

Now that I had something to do other than stand still and think about it, my need to pee had somewhat abated. It was still there, and I'd still have to deal with it soon, but I could manage to sit or stand lady-like for whatever additional instructions he had to give me. After a brief moment to make sure my clothes and hair were still tidy and proper after my commute, and to let another pee-shiver pass through me, I went in.

"Ah, you've arrived. I'll forgive your tardiness this one time. Come stand here in the center of the room. Yes, just there, under the light."

"I'm sorry, sir, I thought I was early."

"And yet, I had to wait. I do not wait on you. You wait on me. You do not ask me for things, I command things from you. This is to be the nature of our relationship. I call it a relationship only because I expect everything from you at all times, and will pay you more money than you likely know what to do with in return. You may be with me all night at times, but entertain no ideas that that will lead to...intimacy. The woman you replace sought to get pregnant by me. She was greedy for a payout beyond her salary, and so now she is gone, and you are here. Don't mess up, Miss."

All through his monologue, my need to pee only grew more insistent. I didn't know how much longer I could hold on, but I didn't dare ask to be excused after a speech like that. I wasn't to ask him for anything, so I tightened my pussy muscles and answered, "Yes, Sir. What may I do for you, Sir?"

"Undress. Keep your jewelry on."

"I'm sorry, sir, did you ask me to undress?"

"I did, and I'll add that I have no intention of repeating myself to you in the future. It's true that I have no intention of sleeping with you, yet I require you to be beautiful," and he gestured to various paintings and sculptures around the room, including what was possibly the original Venus de Milo, "the same way I require my body guard to be intimidating." Again he gestured, this time to a professionally terrifying mountain of a man I had not previously noticed lurking in the shadows.

Apparently, I had not understood how literally I was to take my previous instructions to be eye candy. I was more like one more piece of artwork for his collection. It didn't occur to me to refuse. More than the money this job entailed, he himself had a commanding authority I felt a need to submit to. I undressed, not in an erotic strip tease as I might for a lover, but rather simply disrobing so that he might evaluate me as he likely had each of his nude sculptures before declaring them worthy to inhabit his domain.

He examined me slowly, thoroughly, pacing in circles around me as I stood stone-still. I had been naked in front of men before, but never felt so vulnerable as I did under the lights and his gaze. In a way, it was exhilarating, but all the while I was desperate to pee, and equally desperate not to show I needed to pee. "Lovely face, of course I knew that already from your profile." Another shiver ran down my spine. "Breasts are sufficiently large, and very perky as well." My legs trembled with the effort to hold it in. "Gorgeous long legs, toned, leading up to firm buttocks. Yes, that will do nicely. You must keep still, though."

"Yes, sir, I will."

My body betrayed my words, though, and a large spasm of desperation shook my whole body. "I said, be still."

"Yes, sir, sorry."

"It's fine. I suppose you're just cold. Just take a wider stance so I can see your vulva, and then you may get dressed again." I did as I was told, but spreading my legs took my desperation to a level I didn't believe was possible. He took his sweet time looking at my pussy, and it took every ounce of strength I could summon not to piss all over his face. He must have noticed me literally vibrating with the effort, and began to get irritated with me. "If you can't stand still while I look at you, this might not be a good fit after all."

"I'm sorry, sir." I was now fighting to keep control of my voice as well as my bladder. "It's just I drank too much coffee and I'm nervous and I couldn't go to the ladies room when I got here because you were already waiting and now I really have to pee so bad and taking my panties off only me it worse but you told me not to ask you for anything so I was trying to wait." It all came spilling out of me. The words, that is, not the pee. Not yet. It made me feel like such a silly school girl to gush like that in front of such a powerful man.

"Oh," he said. "I'm finished examining you anyway, so you may urinate quickly and then we'll get to work."

"Oh thank you, sir." I said, now holding myself openly with one hand while I hobbled over to where I had laid my clothes. "Where's the restroom?"

"Oh, I don't have time for that. Just go where you stand."

I had started getting dressed with my panties, and had just finished pulling them up when he told me this. He couldn't be serious, but I also couldn't ask him, and I definitely couldn't afford to stand around thinking about it. I looked at his eyes, and he gave me a curt nod with a "go on" circular hand motion. Beyond that, he simply sat, watching me, and waiting. And he hated waiting.

Looking back, I suppose I could've at least pulled my panties to the side. It's just hard to think straight when you have to pee that bad and the most powerful man alive tells you to hurry up and go. I took my hands out from where they had been frantically squeezing my pee hole shut, stood up tall with my bare breasts held high, and finally let go.

At first, nothing happened except the electric tingle radiating from between my thighs grew ten fold. I'd never felt anything that intense down there, and I didn't know if I would pee, orgasm, or die from it. Finally, he spoke a single word, "pee."

My body obeyed his command as it had not obeyed my own. A hot torrent of pee gushed from between my lips. A solid stream hissed through my lacy thong as if it weren't there and splattered nosily against the exquisite marble between my feet. Tiny rivulets of warmth spurted from either side of the insubstantial strip of fabric, snaking their ways down my thighs. The pee running down my legs and the pee splashing up from the floor met at my knees, and along with the pee soaking slowly up the back of my thong between my ass checks, I was completely soaked in it from the waist down.

Fully relaxed, and yet with an indescribable tension thrumming through my whole body, I fully emptied my bladder in front of him. He watched me wet myself with the same look of disinterested appraisal as he had examined my figure, yet the plainly visible tent he was pitching in the front of his expensive suit pants told me he was enjoying the show. I was enjoying giving him the show, too. It was bliss to finally pee, and it felt even better because I was submitting to his command to pee. It was like my bladder had found the master it had always secretly longed to serve. As my pee stream slowed to a trickle and then just a drip, I pushed one more short but powerful spurt out, just for him.

"Very good, Miss, very good. Are you ready to work now?"

"Yes, sir," I answered him breathlessly, heat flushing my trembling body. "Good. Put the rest of your clothes on and inform the cleaning staff that you've had an accident in my office. We'll be headed down to the conference room to have a board meeting in five minutes, and I need you taking notes, not mopping up urine."

"Yes, sir."

As I got dressed, leaving my pee-soaked panties on under my professional yet sexy outfit, he added one more instruction. "One more thing, Miss"

"Yes, sir?"

"In the future, don't waste my time fidgeting around. You will be managing my schedule, so you will know when your opportunities to urinate will be. If you can't hold it until then, then spare no time or attention trying to do the impossible. Just go."

I worked for him for many years after that, and I never once asked him if I could slip off to go pee. Most days, that just involved holding it a little. I was allowed to go when he was going, and he didn't seem to need to go half as often as I did. So I learned to hold it really well and show no outward signs of my desperation.

Every now and then, though, I couldn't make it. A couple times a month, or maybe once a week, I wet my panties. It was usually an accident, but sometimes he told me to do it as he had that first day. Those times he always watched. He never did anything else, he never touched me, but he always watched, and he always got hard watching.

My German is terrible! I had to use Google to work out "brave" and "horny". I wonder why Duolingo never tried to teach me horny lol. Anyway, I'm glad you found it interesting.

I'm in the middle of working on something else right now (chapter 1 hopefully up tomorrow), but I'm open to the idea of revisiting this later. I usually have an idea or read an experience on here that knocks around my head for a couple days before it turns into something worth writing. I've got something that I think could work into a second chapter of this story, but I could just as well use it somewhere else instead. I'm completely open to suggestions on where this could go while I'm still focused on other stories.
