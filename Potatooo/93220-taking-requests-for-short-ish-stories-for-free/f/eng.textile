Hi everyone, just a guy trying to practice/find a use for my writing.

Normally write non-fetish low-fantasy stuff as a hobby, but today I felt like actually writing something for other people to read, for a change. It seems to me like stories here really do get read, opposed to places such as wattpad and whatnot, so I'll try putting something on here. Never thought the day would come, but eh, it is what it is 🤷‍♂️

I don't really have any ideas right now, so give me some of your requests. If they're interesting I'll write you something.

No underage or male stuff, please. Especially that first one.
