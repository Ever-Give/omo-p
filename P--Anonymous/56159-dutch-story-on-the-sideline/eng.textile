Hi everybody,

I finally found some time to publish another one of my dutch omorashi stories stories on my site, vochtigeverhalen.home.blog.

In this new story, naughty Susan gets the opportunity to pee her pants for an audience. Will she take this chance?

Dutch readers, please let me know what you think of the story. It's only by getting comments from readers that I can improve myself in the future. Don't hesitate to let me know what you think.

To all non-dutch readers: I'm sorry there isn't a proper English translation yet. You will have to use Google Translate for now (which kind of ruins the atmosphere of the story, in my opinion).

Kind regards,

Thanks for your feedback! Hearing from people who like my stories makes me want to write more.

Although many people don't seem to be bothered by the errors Google Translate introduces, I currently started working on proper translations again. I should be able to post the first result soon.

As always, I'm also working on a new story in dutch.

Thanks, Pastafari!

Although I like my stories to always contain some peeing, in most cases it will be preceded by desperation. I think you will like the next few stories better.
