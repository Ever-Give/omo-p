I realize it may be a little late, but I've completed my prompt list for Omovember 2021. I won't be attempting to do them all this year, but I figured I'd make a full list for anyone who wants to. I mostly took inspiration from three tumblrs (linked below), and added a few of my own, my main goal being to not have too many repeats from last year. Hope you like the list! Here you go:

At a party/drunk

Peeing while someone watches

On public transportation

Assisted peeing

Holding/peeing contest

Almost made it

Interrupted while going/about to go

Public pool/water park

While tied up

In the rain

Scared/surprised into wetting

In a movie theater

Peeing lesson/demonstration

On the phone

While on a date

And there was only one toilet!

On someone’s lap

Caught peeing in a strange location

In front of a crush

Too stubborn to admit it

Costume party/cosplay

Peeing from a high-up place

Wetting skintight clothes

In a container

Wetting on purpose

In a uniform/formal clothes

Body swap/dressed as the opposite sex

While undercover

In a school uniform

Free choice!

And here are the tumblrs, in case you want to use some of the ones I didn't.
