You stand still in front of them

Legs wide open, bladder full

With four pints' worth of beer and liquid

– never had to go so bad before –

Excited like that one time

You tried and tried to let it go

Though your Pride, rock-solid

And your Dick, rock-hard

Collided collided collided collided

And wetting was no more.

Just a fart came out instead

Pride had won: the flow was stemmed.

I watch you from a distance

– legs wide open, bladder full –

Tonight you're gonna wet yourself

In front of all these people you don't know.

DO IT!

Four pints'worth of beer and –

DO IT!

Just a fart came out inst –

DO IT!

Your dick [MY DICK!] rock hard –

DO IT!

I stand still in front of them four pints of beer and pride and liquid and pride excited like that dick [YOUR DICK! MY DICK!] one time I tried and tried and tried and –

—

Warm embrace, sweet relief

Down my pants like a thief

Stealthy, wet, copious piss

Down my pants – pure bliss.

I opened my eyes and realized

What I'd always fantasized –

Hug me! Kiss me! Hold my hands –

"Baby, I've wet my pants."
