Actually, quite honestly, I'm working on another project so probably not.

On the other hand, if anyone would like to continue it for me, I would be much appreciative.

This sounds like a wonderful idea! I personally would love to read something like this. I say go ahead and write it. I’m glad to know that I’ve inspired someone else to write!
