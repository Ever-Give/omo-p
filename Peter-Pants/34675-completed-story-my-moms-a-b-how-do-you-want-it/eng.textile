Several years ago I started a story title My Mom's a 'B' that I never finished. I wanted to bring it back. However, having seen many stories 'return' only to be dropped again I did not want to be guilty of the same thing.

So I wrote the WHOLE story and have a completed and edited copy. It's huge (52,000+) words making it equal to the length of some novels.

My question is this. How should I post it? All at once? A section at a time every few days?

Let me know your opinion and I will start posting tomorrow night. Note: I will be changing the title as it can be read as - My Mom is 'AB' which is not what the story is about! (It was supposed to be My Mom is a "B--")
