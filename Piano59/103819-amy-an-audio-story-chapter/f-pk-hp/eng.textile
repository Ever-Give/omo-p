I remember the day all those years ago. I was nineteen, and it was three days after my birthday. I’d started working in a supermarket, which I didn’t much like.

I had to make a hospital visit after work that day, but then a whole series of events led to a chance meeting on a train, and an ordinary day that started without promise led into a night so wonderful I would never forget one moment of it.

So, please relax and play the audio, listen to my account of my life at the time, and a night that changed my life forever.

Hi, Thanks for asking. Chapter 2 got taken down by the Thought Police yesterday. I got a big long warning message which made no real sense, Ch 2 was all about my experience as a child and went nowhere near any 'sexual' content, and I can't see how this steped on any rules, but that's where we are. Any idea what I can do about it ?
