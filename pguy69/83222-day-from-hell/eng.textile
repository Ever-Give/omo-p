Just wanna say this is so far my favorite story on the site. It even inspired my latest drawing. I adore the sheer ridiculousness of the very end and found it incredibly hot. Characters being pushed to the very edge, battling obstacle after obstacle in their (possibly futile) quest for relief is my thing. Keep it up!
