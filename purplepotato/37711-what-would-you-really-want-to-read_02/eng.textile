Ugh I'm so sorry guys I excepted waaaaaaaaaay less than this. I guess I forgot to mention I don't play video games or watch movies and all that. I've read Percy Jackson though! The complete prompt book is something I found would be much easier to finish before posting in chapters. I've written some, but there all shity. I might post some random stories separate, so keep an eye out. sorry guys.
