Chapter 1: Pee Dreams and an Embarassing Accident

Avery had been experiencing odd dreams lately. Dreams filled with fountains, crowds, and broken toilets, with him running around trying to find a place to relieve an achingly full bladder. He was in one now, desperately pushing his way through a huge crowd toward a bathroom. Averys eyes were fixated on the big sign above the door as he got closer, tearing up a bit when he got close ebough to see an enormous line for the men's. The women's, somehow, was entirely empty, and the thought of darting inside and quickly relieving himself crossed his mind…but he quickly pushed the thought aside.

Minutes ticked by and the line didn't move a single inch. Avery sighed, frustrated, and looked around quickly for another option. There were some trees nearby, but there were so many people around that there was no way for him to relax. Avery was horribly pee shy, struggling to use even private stalls unless he was utterly bursting. A sharp throb from his bladder made him double over slightly, and he squirmed in place embarrassingly.

Avery couldn't stand it any longer. He quickly made his way toward some nearby trees, ducking behind one. Despite being alone, he felt like he had a thousand eyes on him. Avery undid his pants and pulled himself out, aiming as he glanced around quickly. He closed his eyes, trying his best to relax, trying to let go of the liters of fluid in his stretched bladder.

“Come on…” He mumbled, bearing down a bit. Still, nothing happened.

“Avery!” The sound made him jump, and he quickly tucked himself away before the dream abruptly ended and he awoke with a start. “Avery? Sweetie?” His boyfriend, Xander, was rubbing his shoulder gently.

“Nnh…!” Avery scrambled out of bed and practically sprinted to the bathroom, rushing inside and whipping out his member just as his bladder released with a loud hiss. “Aah…!” Avery gasped, then exhaled slowly.

“Shit, did you almost piss yourself again?” Xander was standing in the doorway, peeking in.

“Uh-huh…” Avery moaned, bladder still emptying. Xander frowned.

“That's the third time this week you've woken up so full…” He mused, still frowning.

“I know.” He sighed as he finished up, then tucked away his member again and flushed the toilet, then went to wash his hands. Avery looked at himself in the mirror, his ashy blond bangs stuck to his sweaty forehead and his expression relieved. “I must've had too many beers again last night.” Avery chuckled, turning to look at Xander.

“Must have.” Xander said, yawning and looking at his watch. “Hmm…it's almost time to get up anyway. I'll go make the coffee.” He turned and made his way to the kitchen, Avery following behind.

The two had coffee and toast together before Xander got dressed and left for his job, while Avery retreated to the desk in the bedroom to log in for his. Avery worked from home, his anxiety and pee-shyness so severe it affected his ability to leave the apartment for long. There was no way he could possibly hold his bladder for an entire 8 hour shift, plus a commute, especially if he wanted to be hydrated. So he worked at home, drinking from a large water bottle that he refilled often and taking bathroom breaks every couple of hours.

His work day passed uneventfully, until he got a message from Xander about an hour before his shift was going to end.

'Home soon. 🙂 Let's go out for dinner?'

Avery frowned, uncertain. He could make it out for dinner and a few drinks without needing a bathroom tonight…right…? And he always had fun when they went out…

'Sure! The usual place?' He texted back.

'Yeah. We'll go as soon as I get home and change.'

'Okay.' Avery smiled and put his phone down, getting back to work. He shifted slightly in his seat, bladder throbbing a bit. He'd been drinking a lot of water and had drank an energy drink about an hour ago, which was all accumulating in his bladder. But he didn't have long before his work day was over…Avery crossed his legs and sat up straighter, focusing on work and ignoring his bladder as it continued to fill.

4 pm rolled around, and Avery sent off one last email before clocking out and logging out for the day. His swollen bladder was nearly screaming by now, irritated from the diuretic effect of the energy drink and begging for release. Avery stood, then hurried to the bathroom.

Avery pissed for over a minute, his hydrated pee nearly clear. He heard the front door open as he was washing his hands, and left the bathroom to meet Xander in the entryway.

“Hey.” Xander smiled, kicking off his work shoes and pulling off his shirt. He headed into the bedroom with Avery, where the two changed into nice but casual clothes. Avery wore dark blue jeans and a pastel green button-up shirt and Xander wore black leather pants and a long sleeved black shirt underneath a dark blue denim vest.

Once dressed, the two left the apartment and walked a ways down the road to their favorite spot: a bar where they could play games as well as get drinks and appetizers.

A few hours later, after a plate of nachos, potato skins, and three drinks apiece, plus plenty of water, Avery was feeling a dull ache building in his abdomen. He was eating the last of the nachos, waiting for Xander to get back from the bathroom.

“Ah, that's better.” Xander said, smiling as he slid back into the booth across from Avery. “Ready to head out soon?”

“Yeah.” Avery admitted. He wanted to stay longer, but his bladder was really starting to ache. “Uh…now?” He asked, blushing just slightly and crossing his legs, subtly hinting at his need to Xander. Xander understood and nodded.

“Of course.” Xander smiled, then stood again. Avery did the same, grimacing just slightly as gravity caused his bladder to shift. Anxiety was beginning to creep up. He glanced toward the bathrooms briefly, wishing he could just pop in and relieve himself so they could stay longer, but the thought alone terrified him. “Let's go, babe.” Xander said, reaching out to take Avery's hand. Avery took it and walked with him, leaving the restaurant after stopping briefly to pay.

The two made their way home, pressure building in Avery's bladder rapidly. Much faster than he had anticipated. So fast that it felt like the last drink he'd had was pouring into his bladder all at once. He squeezed Xander's hand as his anxiety continued to build. Oh God I've gotta go… He thought, glancing down an alleyway as they passed it. How easy it would be to duck in there and hide behind a dumpster, whip himself quickly, and relieve the ocean in his bladder…

“Avery? Babe?” Xander asked. Avery looked at him, blushing red when he realized he'd stopped. “Everything alright…?”

“Um…” Avery glanced down the alley again. “I just…um…S-sorry, let's go.” Avery stammered and started walking again, his bladder sloshing away in his pelvis.

“We'll be home soon, babe.” Xander reassured him, matching his pace to Avery's. Avery nodded, grimacing slightly at a stab of pain through his bladder. His anxiety was increasing as fast as his bladder was filling, and soon Avery was sweating and breathing rapidly, on the verge of utter panic. “Shh, shh, it's alright, babe…” Xander murmured to him softly, continuing to walk. Avery just nodded, forcing himself to move forward.

They weren't far from home when Avery's panic was reaching a peak, and his bladder was reaching its utter limit. Xander was talking to him soothingly, but Avery could barely focus on what he was saying. His abdomen felt so full and distended, bladder pushing against his waistband. It was getting harder to walk, and Avery was slightly hunched over.

“Avery?” Xander asked. Avery had stopped again, one hand buried in his crotch and tears stinging his eyes.

“I-I-I….I'm gonna….nnh…” Avery grunted in pain as another stab of pain ripped through his lower abdomen. “Oh, no…O-oh…” His breathing got shallower, tears rolling down his cheeks now. He whimpered softly, bladder contracting hard. “I…I…Xander…!” Avery looked up at his boyfriend tearfully, managing to gasp out another soft, “Oh…” as his bladder contracted again, forcing out a spurt.

“Shhh…” Xander leaned close to Avery's ear, squeezing his free hand. “Breathe. Breathe and just let it out, okay? You're hurting yourself…” Avery gasped at a sharp throb through his bladder and urethra, squeezing Xanders hand hard and closing his eyes. 'Let it out…let it out…' Avery repeated in his mind, trying to make it happen. He shuddered, gasping rapidly and crying fully now. He was so, so, so full, desperately trying to relax and empty the ocean inside him. But the only fluid leaking from Avery were tears and sweat.

“I can't, I can't…” Avery gasped and squeezed his crotch again. “I can't…!” He was still panicking, starting to sob. They were so close, yet getting home before his bladder erupted felt impossible.

“Shh, sweetheart, relax…” Xander murmured to him, rubbing his shoulder. “Relax and focus…let your bladder empty…even if you just get out a little bit, we'll at least be able to get you home so you can finish…”

Avery nodded, taking a slightly deeper breath and straightening up a bit. He tried his best to relax, closing his eyes and slowly relaxing every muscle in his body. Finally, a spurt, then a few agonizingly slow dribbles. Avery relaxed further, his breathing slowing down and another few dribbles slowly soaking the front of his pants.

“O-okay…” Avery mumbled, opening his eyes and looking up at Xander again. “I think…I think I can get home now…” He glanced down, blushing crimson at the sight of the baseball-sized wet spot on the front of his pants.

“Good.” Xander looked a bit relieved. He took Avery's hand again, and the two continued on back home. Avery pulled the front of his shirt down a bit in embarrassment, still blushing red. He was walking slowly, hunched over awkwardly and panting again.

“O-oh…god…!” Avery moaned and doubled over, grabbing his crotch. Xander tugged his arm lightly.

“We're close, Avery, just a little further…” Xander said. Avery's breath was coming in small gasps again, and he stopped suddenly, squirming desperately. “Avery?” Xander stopped too. Avery whimpered, doubled over again.

“I'm…I'm gonna…nnnhhhhh….” Avery gasped and clutched his member through the wet fabric of his pants.

“Avery?” Xander asked, worried. “Avery, sweetie…” Xander bit his lip, then quickly made up his mind. Xander scooped Avery up into his arms, causing the smaller man to gasp and tense up, then quickly continued toward their apartment.

By the time they got to the door, Avery was in the midst of a panic attack, his shallow gasps interrupted by sobs. He had wet himself a bit more, bladder completely at its limit, and was currently gripping his member through his pants. “Avery!” Xander got inside with him, closed the front door behind them, and sprinted to the bathroom with Avery. “Go on, go on, just go, okay, Avery?” Xander set Avery down in the bathtub. “Go…”

Avery, still sobbing and gasping, completely lost control. Urine exploded out of him with a powerful hiss, soaking his pants and then running down the bathtub drain.

“A-ah…!” Avery gasped, then slowly relaxed. “A-ahhhh……” Urine continued to hiss out, draining from the tub quickly. “Mmmmhhhh….” Avery moaned, his breathing slowing down.

“There we go….” Xander murmured. “Relax.”

“S-s-sorry…I…I…” Avery broke down into tears again, his bladder still emptying with a muffled hiss. “I…” Avery wiped his eyes.

“Avery…” Xander mumbled. “It's alright. Really.” He watched as Avery relaxed further, shuddering as the last few dribbles made their way out. “You really had to go, goddamn.”

“Y-yeah.” Avery admitted, looking down at his wet clothes with a disgusted expression. He sighed.

“You know…babe…” Xander said gently. “Maybe you should see that therapist… This is…it's really affecting you. You can barely leave the apartment…” Avery teared up again. He was reluctant to see a therapist, so embarrassed about his pee shyness he could barely talk about it to anyone but Xander. But deep down he knew Xander was right. He had to do something about this, at least…

“Y-yeah…you're right…” Avery said, nodding slowly.

“Let's get you cleaned up, alright?” Xander said gently. Avery nodded and stripped off his wet shoes, soaked pants and underwear, and shirt, dropping them all into a pile next to the bathtub. Then, he turned on the shower and started to scrub up, feeling embarrassed and a bit disgusted by himself.

Yet, at the same time…

There had been something rather…arousing about losing control like that….especially in front of Xander. It bad been so…intimate…

Avery blushed red and tried his best to push the thought away, rinsing off quickly and exiting the shower.
