You stand still in front of them

@@legs wide open, bladder full

@@with four pints' worth of beer and liquid

– never had to go so bad before –

@@excited like that one time

@@you tried and tried to let it go

@@though your Pride, rock-solid

@@and your Dick, rock-hard

@@collided collided collided collided

@@and wetting was no more.

Just a fart came out instead

Pride had won: the flow was stemmed.

I watch you from a distance

– legs wide open, bladder full –

@@tonight you're gonna wet yourself

@@in front of all these people you don't know.

DO IT!

Four pints'worth of beer and –

DO IT!

Just a fart came out inst –

DO IT!

Your dick [MY DICK!] rock hard –

DO IT!

I stand still in front of them four pints of beer and pride and liquid and pride excited like that dick [YOUR DICK! MY DICK!] one time I tried and tried and tried and –

—

Warm embrace, sweet relief

@@down my pants like a thief

@@stealthy, wet, copious piss

@@down my pants – pure bliss.

I opened my eyes and realized

@@what I'd always fantasized –

Hug me! Kiss me! Hold my hands –

"Baby, I've wet my pants."
