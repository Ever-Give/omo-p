It was an extremely long day and it was only three in the afternoon. Sure, the villain activity was slightly decreasing after the war, and heroes could finally catch a breath. But not today. It started with an annoyingly boring meeting with a few fellow young heroes who had a collaboration with the same company as Deku. They had to choose some clothing pieces they would gladly promote, and the company decided how to sort out the merches in order to avoid competition within their own brand.

Deku usually liked hero marketing as a topic, but this one was unnecessarily long and detailed. The only bright side of the meeting was that he could sit next to Iida and Uraraka. He didn’t really have time to meet his friends as often as he wished. They were all busy these days, so it was nice to have a chance to talk with them. Even if Uraraka seemed to be a bit of uncomfortable. Later she admitted she needed to pee badly during the whole meeting. Deku was polite enough not to laugh at her, but later as he went on with his day, he started to understand his friend.

After the meeting he had an emergency alert, so he had to run straight to the site. It was a pleasantly tiring fight with no serious casualties. After that he ate lunch with his mother. By that time he could feel a slight pressure in his lower abdomen that reminded him to the fact that the last time he used the toilet was in the morning. He really wanted to excuse himself real quick, but he didn’t want to interrupt his mother who was happily telling a kind story about some of her colleagues.

At the end of his lunch break he had to hurry to another villain attack that was way more serious than the previous one. He couldn’t even handle everything on his own, he had to cooperate with Hero Shouto. It was a nice experience to work together with him, but by time they closed the case his growing urge to pee was making him too uncomfortable.

It was three o’ clock and he was late for his next meeting. With Kacchan and their lawyer. They were about to open their own hero agency and that meant they had a lot of paperwork to handle. Deku bit his lower lip as he headed towards the lawyer’s office to meet his future hero partner and face his rage.

He really wanted to go and relieve himself before the meeting started, but as soon as he arrived, Kacchan grabbed his arm and started to lead him to a door.

“I hate small talk,” he grunted. “And because of you I had to ask him about his hobbies and other shit.”

“I’m sorry, Kacchan,” Deku said. He didn’t want to make him even more upset, but he really needed to pee now. He knew this was his last task for the day, but somehow he felt unsure about his holding capacity. He could feel the need for like three hours now, and it was bad. Really really bad. “Can I just find a bathroom real quick?”

“No way, he will charge an extra fee if we make him wait further,” Kacchan shook his head. “You can go after the meeting.”

“Oh, sure,” Deku nodded and he tried to smile, but he started to become anxious as they took a seat over against their lawyer. They had meetings in the past as well, so it wasn’t an entirely new experience to hear the legal background of establishing a new agency. However, it was difficult to focus on the conversation when his need made him squeeze his thighs together. He grabbed the side of his chair so firmly as it was his last hope.

Fortunately Kacchan was prepared enough to be able to hold the conversation while Deku fought for his costume’s sake. He didn’t have to pee this badly since junior high, when he almost wet his pants during a P.E. lesson. Deku closed his eyes as he remembered that day and his grip on the chair became firmer as he felt the desire to grab himself instead.

He rubbed his thighs together to ease the pressure, but once he started squirming, Kacchan looked at him for a moment. That made Deku freeze and he almost lost control for a moment. Oh, no. Kacchan’s eyes locked on him questioningly, and Deku sent him a pleading look.

Without asking any questions, Kacchan turned back to the lawyer and finished their meeting relatively quickly. At the end of the appointment they both had to sign some papers, and for Deku it turned out to be a real torture, because he couldn’t focus on anything other than holding his pee in. The lawyer seemed oblivious, while Kacchan had to be aware of his situation, because for once he used his manners (or the lack of them) to cut the chit-chat part and leave.

“Where is the bathroom?” Deku asked him as soon as they left the lawyer’s office. He couldn’t even pretend to be fine at that point. He needed to pee badly. So badly. It was a real nightmare to stand still, let alone not pressing his thighs together.

“This way,” Kacchan grabbed his arm once again and led him to the bathrooms of the building. Deku almost lost control when he was forced to walk. He could literally feel the relief at the thought of finally letting go, but then he had to face the reality; the door was locked. “Shit.”

Shit, indeed.

“Why do they keep it closed?” Deku panted desperately. His hand flew towards his crotch, but he resisted on grabbing himself. But this movement alone made him ashamed as he caught Kacchan’s worried glance.

“I don’t know. I’ll find a key for you.”

“No… I’ll just go home, I guess,” Deku gulped. He knew he was close to having an accident and he didn’t want it to happen in public. In a legal department. In front of Kacchan.

“C’mon, Deku,” Kacchan grunted. “We are their clients, they have to let you use their shitty bathroom.”

“It’s fine, Kacchan,” Deku shook his head, and he turned tail and marched to the exit as fast as he could. He had no idea what could he do to ease the pressure on his bladder or how could he make it home with dry pants, but he just had to leave.

It was painful to walk when all he wanted was to finally let it go. He had to go. So badly. He had to pee. He was on the verge of pissing his pants even if he was a grown adult. A well-known hero.

“Get in the car, Deku.”

Kacchan’s voice startled him so much that he could feel a tiny spurt making its way into his underwear. The wetness he felt made his heart sink and his eyes tearing up. Kacchan shouldn’t see him like this. They were finally on good terms. They talked on a daily bases, they decided to open a hero agency together. Sometimes it felt like there was something even more between them.

And here he was, standing on the road with slightly wet underwear, all teary and on the verge of losing control of his painfully full bladder. Deku wanted to die, because he couldn’t run away and hide. It was so humiliating, so…

He could feel Kacchan’s hand on his back, but this time it wasn’t unexpected, his touch was just surprisingly gentle.

“Get in the car,” he repeated, and with that he led him to the passenger’s seat. “I’ll drive you home.”

“I’m not sure if I’m going to make it,” Deku admitted hoarsely. When Kacchan closed the door next to him, he just gave up the remains of his dignity and finally grabbed his penis through his pants. He couldn’t feel the wetness with his hands, but he could definitely feel it from the inside.

Kacchan sat in the car as well and he started the car. He was awfully quiet and that made Deku feel terrible. He didn’t want to ruin their friendship by wetting himself in front of Kacchan. In his car. Oh, God, the car!

“What the fuck happened?” Kacchan finally spoke up, and at the same time a leak escaped Deku’s grip and he moaned desperately as he tried to stop it.

“I didn’t have time to use the loo,” he admitted and he bit his lip as he looked down to check the damage. There was a visible tiny wet spot.

“You should have told me you had to go this bad.”

“I didn’t want to make you mad.”

“Well, now I’m mad,” Kacchan muttered angrily. “But I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at myself. I should be your partner, I should make you comfortable not anxious.”

“Can we discuss your insecurities later?” Deku pleaded desperately. “I want to talk about this stuff, but right now I’m about to piss my pants, Kacchan. And I’m upset, and it’s your new car, and I don’t want to be in this situation, but I can’t hold it, uh, I have to go so badly, Kacchan…”

“Okay,” Kacchan said with a plain tone, then he reached back and grabbed a hoodie from the back seat. He dropped in on Deku’s lap. “Put it between your legs, it might help to protect the seat.”

“But it’s your hoodie,” Deku shook his head as a few tears ran down his cheeks. At the same time he could feel another leak, this time a longer one. He was about to explode.

“And? The washing machine exists, nerd.”

Deku wanted to argue, but now even his hands were wet, so he didn’t really have a choice. He put the hoodie between his legs and pressed it to his crotch. He couldn’t talk anymore, he was too focused on fighting his own body.

He was now silently crying from pain and shame. His whole body was trembling now with the efforts of holding back the flood. He could feel the smell of his urine and it made his heart ache. It was so humiliating…

They were almost at home, when his whole body tensed.

“I can’t hold it anyomore,” he admitted silently, as he felt another leak. “I’m going to pee myself, Kacchan. I’m so sorry, I… no, no, no,” he cried as he couldn’t stop the next leak. Wetness quickly spread through his pants to Kacchan’s hoodie, as he finally reached the relief he desired so much. His hands were trembling as he held the hoodie.

“It’s okay-“

“I’m still going,” Deku interrupted him with a sob. It didn’t matter how badly he tried to protect the car, soon the only sound they heard was the dripping noises as his pee was flowing under the seat. He couldn’t stop, he just emptied his bladder fully.

And that was the moment when Kacchan parked the car in front of the building. If he could hold it for a few more minutes…

“I’m so sorry,” he turned to face Kacchan with tears still streaming down his cheeks.

“It’s okay. I should have been nicer back at the lawyer’s. I’m sorry.”

“You were right. I just… I really had to go.”

“Shit like this happens to everyone, Izuku.” As Kacchan called him by his first name, Deku’s chest warmed up a bit. It was still special for him. “Even I have close calls. All the time.”

“Really?” Deku raised his eyebrow in disbelief. “You?”

“Don’t dare to tell it anyone!” Kacchan crossed his arms in front of his chest. “And hey, I won’t tell anyone about this, deal? It can be our secret.”

“Thanks,” Deku sighed. He felt exhausted, but at least he finished crying. “You must think I’m disgusting.”

“Hell no,” Kacchan shook his head, and when Deku peeked to his direction he saw a slight blush on his cheeks. It was confusing at first, but then Deku’s glance wandered lower he saw his future hero partner’s legs tightly crossed as if he was hiding something. Oh.

“Are you into this stuff, Kacchan?” he asked. After this whole scene the least they could do was being honest with each other.

“And if I am? What are you going to do about it?!”

“Nothing. I’m not mad. If you enjoyed this at least a little, then it is not as bad as I felt.”

“I don’t want you to suffer, idiot.”

“It’s okay, Kacchan. I’m the one who had an accident in your car.”

And Deku didn’t really like how it felt to pee himself. But maybe it would be a better experience if he was the one seeing an accident.

“Ch, the car can be cleaned in no time. But are we good, Deku?”

“Yeah, we are,” Deku nodded and he was finally be able to smile as he opened the door. “Next time you experience one of those close calls, tell me about it, Kacchan.”

He didn’t wait for the reply, but as he looked back at his hero partner, he could see him biting his lower lip. He was definitely turned on.
