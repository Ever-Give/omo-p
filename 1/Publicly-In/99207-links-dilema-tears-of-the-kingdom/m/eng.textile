Hey everyone! This is my first story written here, so I’m open to any feedback. My main motivation for this fic was a severe lack of Link in Legend of Zelda omo stories, or male stories in general, so I had to make my contribution. Enjoy!

After a long week of fighting moblins, bobokins, and skeletons with nothing more than a club and some meager branches, Link had finally made it to the Lookout Landing. Exhausted and ready to collapse, he was taken to the emergency hideout, and fell into a deep sleep.

When he awoke, he went to ask the eccentric researcher Purah about his new mission. They discussed his past and the four natural phenomenas to explore over a clear blue pitcher of ice fruit juice.

“Careful Link! This juice has potent power,” Purah warned him, her large eyes blinking as she studied him, not unlike a specimen in a laboratory.

Link, who had been living off of no sleep and raw meat, was delighted by the crisp and refreshing beverage as it glided down his throat and settled cool in his stomach. He gleefully chugged almost a gallon of juice before he remembered his manners. After drinking it, he felt a different aura around him, as if it had some kind of effect on him. Purah, observing his confusion over her round glasses, laughed and told him that he was protected from hot terrain. Link nodded in appreciation, realizing how much colder the his lower half was becoming.

Purah clapped her hands. “Alright Link! I know that you just got back, but I need you to meet with the search party up by Hyrule Castle. They’ve been searching tirelessly for you.”

Knowing his duty, Link nodded and stood up. As he rose, he felt a slight pressure in his bladder, and walked off to search for an outhouse.

Behind him, Purah’s voice echoed across the field. “Link! Hyrule Castle is that way! It’s important that you find the search party as soon as possible.”

Internally, Link groaned. It definitely would have been smarter to go before going on his mission. But Purah’s voice seemed insistent, and considering the state of the world right now, she was right: he didn’t have any time to lose. He turned and lightly ran towards the wooden arch marking the exit of Lookout Landing, with every impact of his foot on the ground ever so slightly jostling his bladder.

Once out of view of the small village, Link slowed his pace to a less uncomfortable speed and started to look for a tree or some cover to let go. He found a small cluster of trees, and walked quickly toward it. After a week of being out in the wild, with few people around, his bladder was used to being able to pee anywhere, and it certainly was strained at the moment. He stepped in front of a tree with his hand on his belt, ready to loosen it, when the ground in front of him began to rumble. The tree in front of him suddenly ripped itself out of the ground and with its roots crawled to him.

Link jumped back and fumbled for his ax. In his hesitation, the tree whipped its head back and hit him hard. He flew back and hit the floor, feeling his health diminish and a sharp pain below his stomach reminded him of his first unfinished mission. Ignoring his need and grabbing his weapon, he swung at the trunk over and over, until at last only an unmoving log of wood remained. He briefly considered peeing on the trunk as payback, but ultimately decided that that was too petty, even for him, and scanned the area for more hidden enemies. After his impromptu battle, his need had substantially grown, but he had lost some health, and needed to replenish it first. Link pulled out a potion of healing and after a second of hesitation swallowed the entire flask, whose contents seemed to go straight to his bladder.

Finally in front of a real tree, he pulled himself out, ready to release himself. However, when he was undoing his belt, he noticed how cold and firm his skin was. Aiming himself at the tree, he just couldn’t go. In disbelief, he pushed his muscles harder, urging his sphincter to relax, but nothing seemed to come out. Apparently, his excess drinking of the ice fruit punch had overwhelmed his body. Link exhaled in disappointment and put himself back away. He’d have to wait until the effects wore off and his inner contents melted.

Taking more careful steps now, Link walked towards Hyrule Castle to find the rescue team. The sooner he could get this over with, the sooner he could return to Purah and she could help reverse his condition.

As he made his way towards the castle, he passed by a villager leaning up against a tall sign, clearly in need of support. Link was never one to ignore someone needing help, but he needed to get to the search team. He’d come back later and help.

Coming over a hill, Link stopped and felt a sinking feeling. There was a bridge over a river in front of him, with a massive Hinox sleeping in the middle of it. He’d either have to fight the Hinox, or find another way to cross the river. Since he didn’t think he had enough weapons or health to fight the Hinox, he sighed and made his way down to the river. He could hold it. Even after sleeping for a hundred years with his stamina, health, and memories dwindled, he still had his determination.

At the edge of the river, the rushing sound of water was not doing Link’s bladder any good, and he squeezed his legs together for a second before stepping into the river. The cold water shocked his entire system, and he inhaled sharply. Now that he was in the water, he couldn’t stop his mind from wandering, how just a day ago he’d let go in a river similar to this one, how wonderful and freeing it felt to stand and alleviate the pressure building inside him as his pee flowed into the water below.

Now in his current state, that euphoric image was making it harder to focus. But somehow a small drop made its way out and into his pants. Surprised, Link tried to see if any more would come out, but none did. Even so, he was glad to see that his situation was temporary, and he would find relief soon. Swimming in the river, Link sorely wished he could release himself in the water, but pushed through. He safely made it across the river and arrived at the ruins.

Entering through the cracked stone archways of a dead civilization, Link’s desperation had skyrocketed. His clothes were still wet, and they dripped as he walked, reminding him with every step of his growing need. After that single drop he had released, Link’s bladder had sorely complained, needing to let go but not having any means to do so. He started to get worried about the time. It had been about half an hour since that one drop, and after none had come. Link was never that great at math, but he realized how soon he’d needed to find the rescue team and get relief fast.

Just as that thought crossed his mind, he spotted a uniform-clad figure in the distance, and strode towards them. A guard was standing there, and she looked surprised to see Link, especially with such an uncomfortable gait. Seeing the inquisitive look on his face, she explained that the captain of the rescue team, Hoz, was at the top of the tower in the castle.

Though his face didn’t show it, Link was dismayed. The tower the guard gestured to was far, with a long curved ramp leading up to it. He groaned and painfully started to walk up the winding path, feeling the weight of his bladder with every step he took. When he got to the tower, he needed to climb the walls to get to the very top. Giving himself a small squeeze, he jumped up and started scaling the walls. As he jumped up the walls, his bladder screamed out at him, but he scrambled up and found Hoz waiting for him. As everyone else had, the captain jumped and remarked on his presence, and talked about the destruction and their mission. Link had heard this speech before. His focus faded, and he gripped himself as subtly as he could through his pants as Hoz rambled on about Hyrule and his team lost in the depths.

Link absolutely could not take it anymore. His desperation was at a level he never thought he could experience, and his pain below his stomach was like no other, a sharp constant pain that demanded to be released immediately. He didn’t even notice a bright light during the conversation. Finally, Hoz stopped talking, and told Link to go report back to Lookout Landing.Thank god, Link thought. At last, he’d be able to get some help from Purah. He yanked out his Sheikah Slate, or he supposed now it was called a Purah Pad, and tapped the nearest shrine to Lookout Landing. He felt himself rise, and everything went black.

Rematerializing near Lookout, his feet hit the ground with a jolt and he doubled over, hands wedged between his thighs. He hobbled like this up the stairs, taking one hand from his crotch to grab the railing, and flung open the door to reveal Purah reading over some papers. Her inquisitive eyes lit up when she saw him, and it was obvious what his dilema was. “Oh, poor Link! Must’ve been the ice fruit, I warned you!” She leaned over Link’s shorter stature, scanning his entire body, hunched over in desperation.

“But oh, this is fascinating! I’ve never had someone ingest so much ice fruit before! May I?” She motioned towards his tunic, and Link nodded hurriedly. Purah’s hands reached under the fabric and lifted it, exposing Link’s bulging bladder. She brushed her fingers across his stomach. His muscles involuntarily twitched and he let out a soft moan. “Wow! It’s ice cold! I need to write this down, this could correlate with so many more experiments-“ she stopped when she saw Link’s expression of pain, and her gaze softened. “Right. Of course. I have just the thing to cure you!” She walked over to her table of plants and glowing liquids and began to prepare a solution.

Link was obviously impatient, but he marveled at Purah’s skills as she deftly handled a series of potions with uncanny precision. She was a little quirky, but had a good heart. Link admired her passion; he trusted whatever she said to do. As she worked, Link crossed his legs and let out a soft whimper against his will. Purah clicked her tongue. “Ah ah ah Link! Be patient, I’m almost done,” she chided him. Sweat beaded on his face. As she turned around with a small flask, her expression changed and she lit up in a way Link did not like the look of.

“Actually, I want to try something new.” Link’s face fell. He was so close to relief it brought tears to his eyes. Purah tried to placate him: “Please Link! It’ll only take a minute, and you’ll get relief so soon! It’s important for my research,” she said with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. “I’ll make you a durian pie!” That was the final convincer, as Link’s main motivation was food. It must be important if she was willing to make such a rare dish. He stiffened, straightened up as much as he could, and nodded in agreement. Purah twirled in happiness. “Wonderful! Let’s go!” She grabbed Link’s arm and led him to the Skytower.

Inside the Skytower, Link couldn’t help but marvel at how tall the structure was, but his need had become his highest priority. He turned to Purah, wanting to get whatever her twisted mind desired over with as soon as possible so he could release the pressure that had been building in him all day, from the near gallon of ice fruit juice and the health potion.

“Okay! Here it comes!” Purah pressed some buttons on a device next to him, and suddenly four metal arms shot out from the floor, clamping each of his limbs and raising him about a foot off the ground, prying his hands from his crotch. He gasped and his eyes opened in alarm, looking at Purah with incredulity. She laughed again. “Don’t be afraid, it’s alright! This is so I can observe you properly.” She winked at him.

“Oh, here’s your promised potion.” She raised a flask of orange liquid to Link’s mouth, and he gulped it down, the potion running down his neck as he swallowed. Immediately he felt a burning sensation travel down his throat and spread throughout his body, but more importantly he felt something loosen in his bladder. His muscles were back to working again!

“Just a second, Link…” Purah hummed as she jotted down some notes, looking at his stomach. The potion had done its job reversing his situation, but it had done too well, and Link had begun to sweat again, panting from the heat and inability to hold his legs together, now that his bladder was working again. Carefully, Purah removed his tunic, revealing red patterns on his stomach from the potion. She gasped in awe and started to take some measurements, wrapping a soft ruler around his stomach, and again neglected to see the look in his eyes, pleading to be let go. “Oh I’m almost done, be good, won’t you?” Purah grabbed Link’s chin and tilted it up towards her, smiling at him with a mix of satisfaction and discovery, and he blushed under her intense gaze. She really seemed to be getting a kick out of his situation. All Link could do was nod and occasionally let out a small whimper as his legs clenched against his clamps, unable to press them together. He was now completely at her mercy.

After what seemed like an eternity, Purah finished her fussing over Link. “Okay! Just one last thing…” She brought over a heavy ceramic pot, not unlike a chamber pot. “I need to collect some of your urine for my data,” she explained patiently, but he wasn’t listening. At this point Link didn’t care where his piss went, just as long as it went out of him. He jerked his head towards his belt, and Purah’s nimble fingers removed his belt and moved his pants out of the way. Now positioned over the pot, Link let himself go.

Starting as a small, painful trickle, pushing his muscles quickly led to a jet gushing out of him. He moaned involuntarily as his pee rattled against the ceramic, a sound that quickly turned into a splashing sound as the pot began to fill up.

And it was filling up fast.

Almost too fast.

Purah realized as soon as Link did that the pot she had brought, as large as it was, was not going to be big enough for the poor young man’s bladder. He looked at Purah in panic, and after hesitating, Purah came to her senses.

“Yes, that should be more than enough for my studies! If you can stop yourself for a second, I’ll let you down, and you can finish going somewhere else, okay?” Link feverishly nodded and tried to make his bladder stop. At first, he kept going as usual, and his sphincter didn’t understand how he had to stop when he had already been going. Gritting his teeth, he was able to squeeze his muscles enough to slow his stream to a trickle with a grunt, and his bladder once again screamed at him to keep going. When he was only dripping into the almost overflowing pot, Purah pressed some buttons on her device, and the clamps slowly lowered Link to the ground.

As soon as he was on the floor, his hands flew to his crotch. He savored the feeling of being able to hold himself, and even after all he had just let go, stopping in the middle had made him want to go even more! Still dripping with every step, he shoved his way out of the tower’s curtained door and stumbled towards a group of secluded bushes.

With no one around and absolutely nothing stopping him, Link whipped himself out and relaxed to his heart’s content. He tilted his neck towards the sky in pure ecstasy, and squeezed his eyes shut as he fully released himself. His knees buckled, and he continued pissing a hearty storm, kneeling in the grass. His euphoria was immense, and the pleasure he felt immeasurable after releasing all that pressure.

When he finished, he buckled himself up, stood, and went back to the underground emergency tent to rest. Tomorrow he would go help that villager with his sign. Tomorrow he would go to the depths to find his rescue team.

Tomorrow he would save the world. Again.
