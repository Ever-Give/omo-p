Includes holding, peeing, desperation and relief

Church, as a christian we all know, the music, the piano playing, hymns and prayers but do we know the after service relief.

One sunday a few years back, before the church closed for good after the service, standing waiting holding myself, quickly leaving my parents talking, i waddled down stairs.

Feeling very desperate and shy i ran into a guy said hi quickly and zoomed into the bathroom. Closed the door

Dancing quickly i took my pants and underwear off and was about to sit on the toilet when pee and blood as i was on my period came shooting out of my pussy and all over the floor in front of the toilet.

Holding in what was left, i sat down on the toilet and let go pee splashing out and messily gushing into the toilet, relief washing over me. Dripping by now i wiped my pussy well, stood up, did rituals and tried to clean the mess up, then put on protection and pulling my pants and underwear up, left the bathroom sanitized hands and went to find family to head home.

Feeling very embarrassed about the event. How many people i know could have heard and replaying it over and over in my mind how the event would have been different.
